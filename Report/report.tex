\begin{abstract}
    This report presents the design considerations, energy modeling, structural components, and implementation feasibility of an IoT-based elephant herd tracking application. The system aims to monitor elephant migration patterns in Southern India (where the author is originally from), using a network of infrared-equipped sensor nodes. Inspired by other short range sensors like the ones used in Ring doorbells, the nodes will detect and localize elephants based on heat signatures. The report then concludes the two best wireless technologies for this application, NB-IoT and LoRa, based on a tradeoff analysis of power consumption, data throughput, and cost efficiency. The final design is both cost-effective and energy-efficient, promising a robust solution for real-world wildlife monitoring.
